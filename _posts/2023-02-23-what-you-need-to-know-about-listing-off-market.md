Are you sick of looking for a house on the open market? If you are, maybe it’s time to begin considering off-market properties. Off-market properties have benefits for both buyers and sellers, so we’re breaking them down before you make your decision.&nbsp;

The biggest pro of off-market properties is that you don’t have to do the heavy lifting of looking for a home. One of the main reasons we joined our brokerage three years ago was because they offered amazing benefits to our clients, including off-market properties.&nbsp;

It’s easy for buyers to understand why off-market properties are great, but they can be fantastic for sellers as well. **Selling off-market takes away all the uncertainty from the process.** You know your buyer is secure, you don’t have to deal with showings, and your sale will be easy.&nbsp;

However, there’s one catch to selling off-market: You don’t get to take advantage of our improving housing market. Now that rates have come down, more buyers are entering our market. You won’t be able to receive multiple offers and get a super-competitive price if you don’t list on the open market.&nbsp;

When you work with us, we’ll give you two prices. One will be what you can get on the open market, and the other will be your off-market value. **Whichever option is best for you, we can help!** Just call or email us to get started. We look forward to hearing from you.
