<center><em>Here&rsquo;s an overview of four new construction communities in our area.&nbsp;</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Hooray\! We made it past 2020, and most of us are ready to seize fresh opportunities in 2021. Letâ€™s start the new year by talking about some awesome new construction options available to homebuyers in our market, shall we? First of all, weâ€™re excited to tell you about **Pulte Homesâ€™ three fantastic townhome communities.&nbsp;**

The first one is Brook Park, with homes starting between $350,000 and $400,000 (lot, base price, and design selections included). Maple Grove is the second townhome community, located right by Brushcreek Elementary and a Hy-Vee store. (Youâ€™re within walking distance to the bakery, so purchase at your own risk ðŸ˜‹). Maple Grove is a little more expensive, with homes ranging from $375,000 to $425,000.&nbsp;

Lastly, Pulte offers the Plymouth community, which is within the Wayzata Public School District. Though Plymouth is the most expensive of the three ($400,000 to $425,000), itâ€™s truly a beautiful community with amazing amenities and features; a luxurious open floor plan, a huge kitchen with an island, and the ability to add a sunroom or master bedroom extension make it well worth the cost.&nbsp;

Right now, **the earliest move-in date for any of these three Pulte townhome communities would be April.** Lots are selling pretty quickly, so if youâ€™re interested in getting in there before summertime, please reach out to us now. Weâ€™d love to share more information on what each community offers and learn more about what matters most to you as a homebuyer.&nbsp;

Next to the Plymouth townhomes, and also with the Wayzata Public Schools District is another great new construction community that we love, Westin Ridge, where youâ€™ll find the perfect community pool. If youâ€™ve seen our previous videos, you know we love partnering with Hanson Builders, a Minnesota-based company; theyâ€™ve teamed up once again with another highly-esteemed, locally-based builder, Robert Thomas, to bring the Westin Ridge vision to life. (If youâ€™ve toured the Creekside community, you know **Hanson + Robert Thomas = homebuilding excellence**). Currently, their Reggie Award-winning floor plan is available for $936,000. They also have another model that just became available for $680,000, which boasts a bonus room above the garage.&nbsp;

The finishes in the Robert Thomas model are incredibleâ€”weâ€™re obsessed with this floor plan, and it deserves all the praise itâ€™s been receiving\! Westin Ridge is right off of 101, and five minutes from Hy-Vee. (Youâ€™ll still have time to grab some tasty treats\!)&nbsp;&nbsp;

Itâ€™s clear that **new construction homebuyers have options aplenty**, but we want to make sure that everyone can enter the market as an informed and empowered consumer. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re rolling out our Happy Hour Home-Buying Seminar via Zoom, which will be tons of fun\! Weâ€™ll be joined by John Olson, one of our go-to lenders and a phenomenal educator on finances and lending practices; his insight will help alleviate some of the stress that accompanies the new construction home-buying process.&nbsp;

In a nutshell, this seminar will teach you how to be a competitive homebuyer in this fast-paced market. Donâ€™t miss out on a great learning opportunity\! If you know any friends or family who are planning for a 2021 home purchase, weâ€™d love it if youâ€™d pass the word along and invite them to this event. It will take place on **Tuesday, January 12 at 7 p.m.&nbsp;**

As always, if you have any questions or real estate needs we can help with in the meantime, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us via phone or email. Weâ€™re here to help, and we look forward to seeing you on Zoom soon\!
