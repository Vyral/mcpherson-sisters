How do you get your home ready for the market?

Before we answer that question, we’ll announce the winner of our recent trivia contest, where we asked our viewers to name Meagan’s favorite thing that she can never get enough of. The answer was...storage\! Congratulations to Scott Nasef, who guessed correctly and will now be receiving a Home Depot gift card.

When getting your home ready for the market, **before you do anything else, you must declutter, depersonalize, and deep clean.** Decluttering and deep cleaning are fairly self-explanatory, but depersonalizing means taking down any family photos. You can replace them with floral arrangements or other types of black and white photos that you can find online and print at home. We know you love your family, but people need to be able to envision living in your home.&nbsp;

If you really want the home to sell for top dollar, here are the top three tips to remember:&nbsp;

**1\.&nbsp; Add fresh paint.** Every room should be the same color and neutral in tone. Here are the top three colors we use all the time that match with any color palette:

* White gallery: This is probably the favorite white we’ve seen. A lot of new construction and existing properties are making their interiors all white, which we love.&nbsp;
* Agreeable gray: This is Sherwin Williams’ top-rated paint color of 2019.
* Revere pewter: If you have warmer, oakish cabinets or accents and need a gray, we highly recommend this one.&nbsp;

**2\. Add new carpet.** If your carpet is over five years old, it needs to be replaced. Not only does new carpet look and feel better, but it can also add $15,000 to $25,000 to your sale price.&nbsp;

**3\. Make sure the home has good lighting.** A new light fixture can completely transform a space. For example, replacing an outdated lighting fixture in your bathroom will completely change its appearance—even if you keep the same paint color. You can find great lighting options at Lowe’s, Home Depot, Wayfair, Menards, and other places.&nbsp;

If you get in touch with us, we know plenty of skilled, experienced professionals we’d love to refer you to who can help you with these items. We’d also be happy to advise you on which paint color, carpet type, or lighting fixture arrangement works best for your home.&nbsp;

Stay tuned for our next video in which we’ll discuss how to get the outside of your home market-ready. If you have any questions in the meantime, just give us a call or send an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
