<center><em>Despite what you may think, now&rsquo;s a great time to buy a home.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Despite the fact that we’re in a strong seller’s market here in Minneapolis, it’s a great time to buy a home.&nbsp;

Although **interest rates have climbed since they hit an all-time low of 2.5% last summer, they’re still sitting at just 3.25%,** which is ridiculously low. If you’re renting, your interest rate is near 8%, which means it’s so much more affordable to own a home. This also makes now a great time to refinance.&nbsp;

With the lack of inventory, many homes are selling far over their asking prices and with multiple offers. This shouldn’t scare you, though. If it wasn’t a good time to buy, these homes wouldn’t be attracting so many offers. You’d be competing against buyers who feel the same way you do. Since last spring, accepted contracts are up 5%. Inventory is a problem, but we’re out there every day, and we’re seeing the terms of the purchase agreements from our listings. We’re telling our buyers what to do because we know what sellers are going with.&nbsp;

**You want to take advantage of rates now because they’re only going up from here.** You can either buy now at a lower rate and for lower comps or wait six months when everything has increased. This is all the more reason to hire a professional real estate team to help you.&nbsp;
