Here are four great tips to improve your home’s curb appeal.

Great curb appeal ensures that your home makes a great first impression on homebuyers. If your home’s curb appeal, or the way it looks to buyers as they pull up, is lacking, **here are some things you can do to improve it:**

**1\. Power wash.** A good power washing can really make your home sparkle. Feel free to reach out to us if you need any advice or need to find a power washer.

**2\. Paint the front door.** It gives your home a fresh pop of color and helps it stand out. The first picture buyers see online is the front of your house, and a fresh coat of paint on the front door makes a huge difference. Some of our favorite colors are La Fonda Deep Clay Red, which is the top Valspar color for 2020, and navy blue is always fantastic. A light eucalyptus green can go with anything as well.

**3\. Flowers.** Fresh, bright spring flowers really enhance your home’s curb appeal and add an additional edge to your yard, making it more warm and welcoming.&nbsp;

**4\. New doormat.** Don’t powerwash your old one. Go to Target or order one on Amazon. Buyers comment on cute door mats all the time. If you need help picking something out, we’re always here to help.

Next time, we’ll talk about what you can do to spruce up your backyard inexpensively. If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. We would love to hear from you.
