Are you in the market for a new home but struggling to find the perfect fit? Have you considered new construction? As certified new construction specialists with experience working for a custom home builder, we have seen firsthand the benefits of building a new home, and right now, there is a huge window of opportunity in our marketplace.&nbsp;

Over the last few years, builders have experienced a lot of success due to the lack of inventory in the housing market. However, as interest rates have started to rise, many potential buyers have been hesitant to pursue new construction. To counteract this trend, **builders are offering amazing incentives to encourage clients to go under contract.**

One of our recent success stories involves a client who was initially hesitant about exploring new construction due to perceived cost concerns. However, after going under contract, they were able to secure $60,000 off the original price, $5,000 in closing costs, and a fixed 30-year interest rate of 4.875%. These incentives are simply incredible and demonstrate the opportunities available for buyers willing to consider new construction.

It's important to note that this window of opportunity is not going to last forever. However, we believe that there are still opportunities in our market, especially for buyers. If you're interested in exploring new construction, don't hesitate to call or email us. We'd love to help you explore what new construction would look like for you and show you just how pleasantly surprised you might be with the options available.
