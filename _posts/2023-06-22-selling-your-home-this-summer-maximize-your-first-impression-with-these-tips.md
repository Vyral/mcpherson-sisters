We would like to discuss selling during the summer and the importance of making a great first impression. Here are a few things you need to do to get your home ready to sell this summer.&nbsp;

The first thing potential buyers see is the exterior of your home, **so landscaping is crucial.** Take the time to weed, add fresh mulch, and ensure you have enough plants to create an appealing curb appeal. It's essential to have a well-maintained lawn and a clean driveway, free of cobwebs.

Additionally, consider power washing the exterior of your home and giving your front door a fresh coat of paint. A painted front door often receives positive comments from buyers and leaves a lasting impression. Remember, buyers will be staring at your front door while their realtors open the lockbox, so it should be in top shape.

**Cleanliness is vital, so clean the windows and storm doors, ensuring everything looks presentable.** Sometimes, dogs may have drooled on the storm door or windows, so make sure to clean them thoroughly. Consider hiring professional window cleaning companies if needed. Another important aspect is a fresh doormat. Buying a new one is not a wasted investment, as you can take it with you when you sell your home. Your old doormat, exposed to winter weather, may not show well.

To enhance the exterior further, consider adding matching potted plants that complement your home's appearance, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Think of how fresh flowers outside a restaurant or business set the tone and atmosphere. **The same principle applies to your home's exterior—a positive first impression is crucial.**

When showcasing your backyard, ensure it doesn't disappoint potential buyers. Scraping and painting your deck is worth the effort, and adding a fire pit with fresh firewood can be appealing to buyers. Twinkle lights can also transform your patio area, creating a charming and inviting space. Even for townhomes, small touches like twinkle lights and umbrellas with beautiful flowers make a significant difference. Buyers often comment on these features and can imagine themselves living and entertaining in the space.
