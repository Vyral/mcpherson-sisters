This week we’re rolling out our Sell, Stay and Search program. With this program, we’ll sell your home for top dollar, you can stay there, and we guarantee we will find your next home. It's very affordable and convenient, but the biggest benefits are that you don’t have to move twice and when you sell first, you know exactly what you can afford.

Every situation is a bit different, so **you can either have the buyer do a leaseback with you or extend the closing window**. You can sell for top dollar and stay in your home with a leaseback. Some buyers are offering sellers rent-free leasebacks. You’ll also be a competitive, non-contingent buyer when you look for your next home. Extending your closing window to 120 days also gives you plenty of time to find your next home.

**Inventory levels are increasing,** so don't wait to buy because interest rates will increase as well. Comps from six months ago will keep prices high as well. Take advantage of this market and the great program we’re offering.

If you guys have any questions or if you're considering selling, reach out to us. We’d love the opportunity to help you.
