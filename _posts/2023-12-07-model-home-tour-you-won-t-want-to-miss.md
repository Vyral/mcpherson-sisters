Today, we’re pleased to share a model home that was recently listed on the MLS! This is a truly gorgeous home that is designed to impress. We’ll take you through the most important parts of the home so you can follow along with the video showing off its best features.&nbsp;

First, there are floor-to-ceiling stone accents with high walls, tall windows, and a deluxe kitchen. The sunroom is probably our favorite room in the house. It’s a great place to read. The stunning primary suite is full of natural light from the tall windows, and it’s home to a large master bathroom that is very spacious. The other bedrooms have large walk-in closets that have tons of room. **Every room of the house is staged to be luxurious and inviting, and you can have it all!**&nbsp;

If you are interested in this property or anything else, please call or email us. We are always willing to help!
