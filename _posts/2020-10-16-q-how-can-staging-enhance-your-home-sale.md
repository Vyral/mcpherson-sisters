<p style="text-align:center;"><em>We’ve brought in an expert to explain the benefits of home staging</em></p>

If you’re preparing your home for sale, staging plays a critical role in selling it quickly and for top dollar. With that in mind, we’ve invited professional stager Lori Shinard from Enhancing Your Home to join us today to discuss why staging is so beneficial.&nbsp;

First, what’s the biggest difference between professional staging and design? Lori describes staging as “fake living.” In other words, it’s more about pictures and appearances. The goal is to make everything seem bigger and brighter. Design, on the other hand, is more about your tastes, or what you need and want.&nbsp;

When it comes to staging, **the three most important areas she always tells sellers about are lighting, floors, and walls (i.e., paint).** Painting and lighting, specifically, are inexpensive ways to update your home, and Enhancing Your Home always tries to minimize costs for these improvements.

When you hire Lori, she looks your house over room by room and gives you a list of staging recommendations, then she helps you follow up on these recommendations. Selling a home can be a big process, especially for those who’ve lived in their home for 15, 20 or even 30 years. Getting a home you’ve lived in for a long time ready to sell is sometimes overwhelming, but **Lori gives you a to-do list that leads to a clear finish line notifying you when your home is ready for photos.** In addition to helping people stage their homes, Lori helps people design their new homes.

For our home seller clients, we include Lori’s services in our listing commission. It’s not an additional fee to have her help you, it’s just a perk of working with the McPherson Sisters Real Estate Team. She only works with your items and never brings in any new furniture. At most, she’ll recommend adding a few smaller items such as fresh white towels or green apples. Green apples, in particular, always show well in pictures, and that’s key to staging—seeing how your home will look in pictures.&nbsp;

Lori is a very talented stager, and we’re blessed to be able to work with her. We want to thank her for joining us today and remind you that if you’d like to know more about the benefits of staging, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.&nbsp;

Also, stay tuned for our next video where we’ll provide a comprehensive update on our shifting market. See you soon\!&nbsp;
