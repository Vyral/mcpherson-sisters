*Cooking With Kathy: gingerbread with lemon sauce*

We’re back with another episode of “Cooking With Kathy” from the McPherson Sisters Real Estate Team\! Last time, we royally feasted on some sweet potato soufflé. For this month’s featured recipe, we’re whipping up a family favorite for the holidays: warm gingerbread with hot lemon sauce. Talk about comfort food\! Just like last month, we have a corresponding recipe card available for you; simply send an email or give us a ring, and we’ll be happy to get that over to you. To find out how you can spread holiday cheer—and amazing, nostalgic smells—with this simple gingerbread recipe, watch our latest video.
