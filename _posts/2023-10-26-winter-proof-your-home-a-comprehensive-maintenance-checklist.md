As the days grow shorter and the temperature drops, it's time to shift our focus to preparing our homes for the winter months. The key to a stress-free winter is proper maintenance, and we're here to provide you with a comprehensive checklist to get your home winter-ready.

**1\. Turn off the water.** One of the most critical steps in preparing your home for winter is turning off the water supply. Locate the valve that controls the water to your home, usually found in the nearest open utility area. Shut off the valve and open the exterior spigot to let any remaining water drain out. This simple action can prevent freezing pipes during the cold Minnesota winter, saving you from a potential disaster.

**2\. Clean your gutters and window wells.** Don't neglect the exterior of your home. Clean out your gutters to ensure proper drainage and prevent snow and ice dams. Similarly, clear out debris from window wells to prevent rot. These steps will maintain the integrity of your home and prevent water damage.

**3\. Check grading around your home.** Inspect the grading around your home to ensure water drains away from your foundation. This will be particularly beneficial when the snow melts in the spring. Consider adding black dirt to enhance drainage, especially if you lack a drain cowl system.

**4\. Maintain mechanicals.** Inside your home, focus on your mechanical systems. Before the frigid temperatures set in, schedule a furnace tune-up with a professional HVAC technician. Furnaces tend to get busy as winter approaches, so don't wait until it's too late. Remember to change your furnace filter monthly for optimal performance.

**5\. Inspect your sump pump.** Check the functionality of your sump pump and consider getting a battery backup. This backup system provides peace of mind, ensuring your basement remains dry even in the event of a power outage or pump failure.

While you can't predict every home maintenance issue, proactive planning can help. Allocate a small portion of your budget, around 1% of your home's value, for unexpected repairs or updates. Use this fund to maintain your home's overall health and address minor issues promptly.

Incorporate these steps into your fall routine, and you'll be well-prepared for a smooth transition into the winter season. Being a homeowner comes with responsibilities, but a well-maintained home ensures your comfort and peace of mind.
