<p style="text-align:center"><em>Our real estate market couldn’t be hotter for home sellers right now.</em></p>

Our lives have been crazy this last week in the most amazing way. We wrote five offers and every single one was up against multiple buyers. With interest rates at record lows, buyer demand remains extremely high. Last week, we had a buyer lock in a rate of 2.85%.&nbsp;

At the same time, we have a severe lack of inventory. There are not enough properties on the market to satisfy the demand of buyers. Obviously, the pandemic has thrown a wrench into many areas of our economy, but the real estate market has prevailed and is poised for a comeback. **It’s a phenomenal seller’s market with record sale prices—need we say more?**

Next week, we’re going to dive in the process of selling your home into this kind of market and where to go from there. How do you find your next home when you’re competing against 17 other buyers? We’ll explore that and much more.

If you have any questions for us about buying, selling, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
