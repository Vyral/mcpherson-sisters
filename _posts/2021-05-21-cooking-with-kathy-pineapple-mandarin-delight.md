Welcome back to another edition of Cooking With Kathy. Boy, do we have a treat for you that’s perfect for Memorial Day Weekend\! **Kathy’s pineapple mandarin delight is always a hit and she’s walking you through the full recipe today.**

First, set the oven to 350 degrees. Then, take a box of Betty Crocker Super Moist yellow cake, 4 large eggs, an 11.5-ounce can of mandarin oranges (with the juice), and a half cup of oil. Then use your mixer to blend it all up.

Next, it’s time to grease a pan with a little cooking spray and pour the batter into it. How easy is that? Then put it into the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.

Once the cake is out of the oven, let it cool. In the meantime, prepare the pineapple topping. You’ll need 1.5 cups of heavy whipping cream and ⅛ of a cup of sugar in a bowl. Then whip it up with the hand mixer. Once it’s mixed, add a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and a pack of Jell-O instant pudding.

Now it’s time to mix the whipped cream, pineapple, and instant pudding, spread it on top of the cake, slice, and serve with a maraschino cherry on top of each slice. Trust us, this one is going to be a hit at your Memorial Day party.
