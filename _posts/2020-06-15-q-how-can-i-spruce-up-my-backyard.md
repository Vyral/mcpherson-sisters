<p style="text-align:center"><em>These four tips will help make your yard into an outdoor oasis.</em></p>

We’re sharing some tips for sprucing up your backyard or patio space. During nice weather, this is the place where you hang out on evenings and weekends; it’s your outdoor oasis, so keep it clean and appealing with these tips:

**1\. Rust-Oleum.** We love this product, especially the high-heat version. It stops rust from forming and makes everything look brand-new and fresh. You can spray it on your grill, patio furniture, or anything else made of metal.

**2\. Pillows, rugs, and umbrellas.** You don’t necessarily have to buy new cushions for your patio furniture, just buy a few accessories. An outdoor rug especially helps if you don’t have time to power wash the patio before a gathering.

**3\. Lighting.** One of our new favorite things is string lights put underneath the umbrella. It’s beautiful and sets the ambiance. We also love lanterns; you can use a flameless or citronella candle to keep mosquitoes away. Additionally, LED solar lights can be put in your landscaping. They come in packs of six, and they even have ones that look like mini tiki torches.

**4\. Basic maintenance.** Pull the weeds, get new mulch, mow your lawn. This may seem obvious, but some of the things we’ve seen in people’s yards are unbelievable. Also, If you have dogs, reach out to us, we know a great treat that helps with keeping their urine from yellowing the grass. They’re good for your dog’s health too!&nbsp;
