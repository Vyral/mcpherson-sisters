<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Here’s how Kathy makes her festive and delicious veggie salad.</em></p>

On this episode of Cooking With Kathy, we’re whipping up a festive, fresh, vegetable salad. **There’s no lettuce in this salad, but there are a lot of delicious, fresh vegetables** (along with a few naughty ingredients that make it a truly great side dish).&nbsp;

I start with 20 oz of Cauliflower florets that are already washed and ready to go. Then I add seven to eight cups of fresh broccoli into the mix. Next, I cut up one small head of red cabbage. It’s already starting to look great\!

The next step is to add one 10 oz bag of frozen baby sweet peas that have been thawed out. Then I take one bunch of green onions, cut those up, and throw them in a bowl with the cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and peas.&nbsp;

**Now it’s time for the “naughty” part: The dressing.** That includes ½ a cup of white sugar, ½ a cup of Kraft grated parmesan cheese, and two cups of mayonnaise. I mix the dressing up separately, and then add it to the big bowl of veggies and mix everything up again.

There is one more very important step to finish this salad off. I’ve cooked a pound of bacon, which is going to go right over the top of the vegetable salad, along with 1 ½ cups of shredded parmesan cheese. **You can see the final product at 6:17 in the video above** and it looks fantastic. This is a great recipe and I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
