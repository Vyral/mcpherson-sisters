<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Here’s the scoop on two stellar new construction communities in our area.</em></p>

Today we’re excited to talk about some new construction communities in our area that we’ve recently done some research on; one is brand-new and the other has been around for a while now, but we’re confident both will pique your interest if you haven’t yet heard about them.&nbsp;

**Here in the popular Wayzata Public School District, there are hardly any new construction opportunities left.** That’s why the up-and-coming community of Ridge at Elm Creek is so exciting. This new construction subdivision is a joint project between five different home builders, and we have a client who already has a lot held through one of them (Hansen). The other four companies include Gonyea, NIH, Creek Hill, and Swanson—all fantastic custom builders\!

The price point is a little spendy; **the Ridge at Elm Creek offers premium single-family home sites ranging from $850,000 to $1.6 million.** When completed, this community will have 106 home sites, a clubhouse, and a pool, making it very similar to the Woods at Rush Creek development (except larger). If you’re considering building a beautiful home in the wonderful Wayzata Schools District, please reach out to us as soon as possible to discuss your options and reserve a lot at the Ridge.&nbsp;

Another great new construction opportunity can be found in the existing community of Bellwether by Del Webb, a division of one of the nation’s largest homebuilders: Pulte. **Bellwether offers a 55+ community with slab-on-grade or villa/rambler-style homesites and an 8,000-square-foot clubhouse.** They also have a full-home activity director, and plenty of activities/amenities to direct: an outdoor fire pit, craft rooms, shuffleboard, ping pong, and an indoor and outdoor pool. Homes here range anywhere from $350,000 to $450,000, making it surprisingly affordable to get access to these great amenities.&nbsp;

All 393 homesites in Bellwether offer one-level living, **which makes Bellwether perfect for older folks who are looking to downsize without sacrificing a true sense of community.** An association manages everything in this community and makes sure residents stay safe; its monthly fee is just $216.&nbsp;

We (Jennifer and Meaghan) are certified new construction home specialists who love to keep a finger on the pulse of development in our area; if the communities highlighted today appeal to you, don’t hesitate to give us a call.
