Have you heard about our small business partnership program? For 25 days in December, we highlighted a new small business each day, but now that we’re in the new year, we’ve decided to take things a step further. **Now, we’re offering a small business partnership year-round.&nbsp;**

What does this mean? Essentially, if you own a small business or know someone who does, we want to be their go-to Realtors. We’ll promote them and offer them significant savings whenever they buy or sell a home with us.&nbsp;

This year, we want to build new partnerships and strengthen our current relationships. At the end of the day, **referrals are the lifeblood of small businesses,** so why wouldn’t we help each other out?

If you would like additional information about starting a partnership with us, please call or email. We’d love to work with you!
