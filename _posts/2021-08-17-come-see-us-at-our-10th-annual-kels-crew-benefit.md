*Here’s what you need to know about our upcoming Kel’s Crew Benefit.*

Our 10th annual Kel’s Crew Benefit is just around the corner, so today we’d like to talk more about this event, why we began hosting it, and how you can participate this year.

**The benefit takes place on Saturday, September 18 at Mama G’s from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.** We started it after our sister Kelly passed away from leukemia at 27. In addition to our benefit proceeds, we donate $100 for every closed transaction we do in our real estate business.

Right now, our goal is to raise donations for our raffle—if you want to help out, you can donate things like gift baskets, gift cards, food, and anything you think could help raise money.&nbsp;

We raise money through the raffle, silent auctions, bake sales, and donations. We also offer a ton of kid-friendly activities, and there’s plenty of food for attendees. Mama G’s has a huge patio and a bar, so people can play volleyball and basketball, have a drink, and just enjoy the atmosphere.

We take all the charitable contributions we’ve gathered and donate them in Kelly’s memory. **We light a memory lantern in honor of her, and the following weekend, we participate in the Light the Night Walk.&nbsp;**

These events are always a beautiful and touching experience, and we’d be happy for you to join in with us this year. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us. Until then, we look forward to seeing you there\!
