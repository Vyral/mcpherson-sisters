As real estate professionals, we know what’s happening every day in the Minneapolis area, specifically concerning home values and how these trends and developments will directly affect you.&nbsp;

**Even as this ongoing pandemic is changing our market, we're out on the front lines to make sure that those changes are communicated to you.**We are considered an essential business, which we are grateful for. Therefore, we are working as hard as ever while staying safe. In fact, it is actually a great time to buy or sell your home.

Buyers have interest rates at historic lows in the 3% range. There's a lack of inventory, so sellers don't have much competition to go against, and home values are holding strong. Buyers who are worried they won’t find something with the lack of inventory, fear not — The McPherson Sisters Team is here. We have LOTS of creative ways to get you into your dream home.&nbsp;

**Being a cloud - and internet-based brokerage, we have more than enough tools at our fingertips to protect our clients' health and allow them to still buy and sell homes;&nbsp;**Matterport 3D and live virtual tours, Facetime showings and complimentary market analysis appointments via Zoom are just to name a few. &nbsp;

**We plan to send you two helpful messages each month to keep you updated and help you stay on top of what’s happening in the real estate market.&nbsp;**Please do not hesitate to call or text with any questions you have for us.

We are here to be your real estate experts and would be delighted to hear from you.
